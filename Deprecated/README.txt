This software is intended for post-processing chromatograms by picking peaks, and automatically calculating height, integration, width at half height,  and theoretical plate count.

Currently, this program only supports .asc files exported from Shimadzu CLASS-VP analysis software. 

The program runs from "main.py"

The script "modules.py" uses error handling to install essential modules if they cannot be imported

Sample chromatograms are stored in the "sample chromatogram" folder

Objectives for future development are stored in "agenda.txt"

Code that I used to test modules is stored in the folder "test and example code"
